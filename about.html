    <div class="box">HISTORY <hr>
        <p>Kwekwe Polytechnic began life in the late 1970s when Union Carbide (Pvt) Ltd – later renamed ZIMASCO – built a training institute on a former farm owned by Mr Judd, to develop skilled workers for the mining and heavy‑industry sector. Construction finished in 1980, just as Zimbabwe won independence, and the following year the newly equipped campus was donated to the government and people of Zimbabwe. The first intake of students arrived in January 1981, studying Automotive, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, and the official opening took place on 4 December 1981, presided over by Deputy Prime Minister Cde. S.V Muzenda, with Eng. E.C Judd serving as the inaugural principal </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Over the next two decades the institution expanded its portfolio: the Commerce Studies Division launched in 1984, the Adult and Continuing Education Division followed, and the NASS Division was added in 2003 – the same year the technical college was formally upgraded to a polytechnic. In August 2004 the college received a mandate to award degrees, beginning with a Bachelor of Technology (Honours) in Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering in February 2005, later joined by a B.Tech (Honours) in Electrical Power and Manufacturing Engineering in 2011. Today Kwekwe Polytechnic continues to grow as a leading, degree‑granting institution, offering a range of certificates, diplomas and honours degrees across engineering, commerce, applied sciences and continuing education</p>
